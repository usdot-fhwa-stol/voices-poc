    fake_api.py

    This module is only provided as an example. It emulates a simplified API for demonstration purposes.
    It provides functions to retrieve LandVehicle and TrafficSignalController objects.
    It also includes a 'vehicle_algorithm' to use as an example for breadcrumb/waypoint following.

    Functions:
    - vehicle_algorithm(): Simulates a distrance-tracking function by returning a cumulative distance traveled
    - get_vehicles(): Returns a list of example vehicle objects
    - get_trafficSignalControllers(): Returns a list of example traffic signal controller objects
"""

import random

def vehicle_algorithm():
    """
        Simulates a total distance traveled by a vehicle.

        Uses a function attribute 'previous_distance' to track cumulative distance across calls.
        Each call increases the distance by a random float between 0 and 2

        Returns
        -------
        vehicle_algorithm.previous_distance: float
            The total distance traveled

def get_vehicles():
    """
        Simulates retrieving a list of vehicle objects from an API.

        Returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a vehicle object with example attributes.

        In this example, there are 5 vehicles platooning down a straightaway
