"""
    json_transmitter.py

    Template script demonstrating how to send and receive object SDOs in JSON format using threading for concurrent operations.
    This script is intended to serve as a starting point for distributed-testing event participants utilizing the JSON Tools applications
    to send and receive object SDOs.

    Configuration:
    - The script includes several global variables that can be customized to suit the user's environment and needs.
    
    Helper functions:
    - waypoint(): Reads a CSV file of waypoints and creates a list of dictionary objects (waypoints) for determining location.
    - get_object_data_from_waypoints(): Utilizes the distance traveled retrieved from a custom vehicle algorithm, and the waypoints
        from the CSV file to determine the location of your vehicle. Custom logic is needed for vehicle algorithm, determining location using waypoints,
        and packing object data.
    - get_object_data_from_api(): Returns a dictionary containing object data that has been retrieved via API and transformed to match the necessary structure.
    - wait_for_port(): Wait for a TCP port on a host to become available.
    - transmit_object_json(): Transmit object SDOs to the Publisher REST API.

    Example functions:
    - get_count_of_objects(): Returns a running count of the number of JSONs received for each entity type

    Main threaded functions:
    - transmit_main(): Runs in a thread to continuously:
        1. Retrieve object data (via waypoints or API, depending on configuration)
        2. Package the data into SDOs in JSON format using json_templates
        3. Transmit the SDOs via REST API to the JSON Publisher
    - receive_main(): Runs in a thread to:
        1. Open a socket and bind to a specified host and port
        2. List for incoming SDOs from the JSON Streamer
        3. Print incoming SDOs to the console (From this point the user would modify this section to get the data into their application)

    Main features:
    - Supports multiple coordinate formats (e.g., geocentric, ltpENU)
    - Supports multiploe object types (e.g., LandVehicle, TrafficSignalController)
    - Concurrent transmission and reception using threading.
    - Configurable data source (Waypoints or API)

    Usage:
    - Configure global variables at the start of the script to match your enviornment
    - Customize or extend the helper functions to get object data to/from your application in the format expected by the script and templates.
    - Run the script using "python3 ~/distributed-testing/scripts/json_scripts/json_transmitter.py". Two threads will start:
        1. One for transmittion object SDOs to the JSON Publisher
        2. One for receiving object SDOs from the JSON Streamer

        Generate object data based on waypoints and a system control algorithm

        This function takes a list of waypoint dictionaries (from waypoint()) and utilizes some custom progression algorithm

        the function uses that to determine the object's location with respect to the provided waypoints.

        Users MUST modify this function to fit their simulation or real-world system.
        For example:
        - Use the nearest waypoint already passed (default example implementation)
        - Interpolate between waypoints for smoother motion
        - Apply a custom motion model for velocity/acceleration updates
